# ML-project-Dry-beans-classification
Dry beans classification using machine learning techniques.

This project aims to build and optimize predictive models for the given dataset using various machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning techniques. The project involves several critical stages: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), preprocessing, model pipeline construction, and extensive hyperparameter search using methods such as Grid Search, Bayesian Optimization, and Genetic Algorithms. The models considered include Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
